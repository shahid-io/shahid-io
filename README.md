# Shahid Raza — Backend Engineer

Hi, I’m Shahid.
I’m a software engineer who enjoys building systems, solving problems, and writing clean, maintainable code.

---

## What I do
- Design and implement scalable RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- Build microservices and event-driven systems for real-time and background processing
- Optimize data models, queries, and caching strategies for PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Redis
- Containerize and deploy services with Docker and CI/CD pipelines
- Ensure reliability with monitoring, logging, and automated testing

---

## Core strengths
- API design & documentation (OpenAPI / GraphQL)
- Microservices & message-driven architectures
- Database design, indexing, and query optimization
- Observability: logging, metrics, and tracing
- Test-driven development, integration tests, and contract testing
- Clean code, SOLID principles, and pragmatic refactoring

---

## Tech stack
- Languages: Node.js (TypeScript), Java, Python, Go
- Frameworks: NestJS, Express, Spring Boot, Flask
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Infrastructure: Docker, Git, Linux, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)

---

## How I work
- API-first mindset: design clear contracts and document them
- Prioritize observability and error handling from day one
- Keep services small and focused — minimize blast radius
- Prefer incremental improvements and measurable outcomes
- Collaborate closely with product and frontend teams to ship value faster

---

## Open to
- Backend systems, API design, and system architecture roles
- Contract and freelance work on backend projects
- Mentorship and code reviews for backend teams
